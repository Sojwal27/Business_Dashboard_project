Internship Project Summary

During my internship, I was assigned a large-scale data project involving a dataset of over 1.8 million entries. My primary task was to clean and prepare the data for analysis and business use.

I started by performing data cleaning, which involved removing duplicate records, handling missing values, and standardizing formats to ensure consistency and accuracy. I used tools like Python (Pandas, NumPy) and SQL to efficiently process the dataset and make it suitable for backend integration.

Once the data was cleaned and optimized, I designed and developed a web-based business dashboard that presented key metrics and visual insights. The dashboard was built with a focus on user experience, clarity, and responsiveness, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and charting libraries for data visualization.

On the backend, I connected the cleaned dataset to the dashboard using Flask, ensuring smooth and scalable data retrieval. Special attention was given to query optimization and performance to handle such a large volume of data without delays.

This project gave me hands-on experience in working with big data, data engineering, and full-stack development, along with improving my skills in building real-world data-driven web applications.
